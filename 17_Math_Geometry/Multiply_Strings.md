# Multiply Strings

## Problem Statement

Given two non-negative integers represented as strings, return their product.

**Note**: The input strings do not contain any leading zeros, except the zero itself.

**Example 1:**
```
Input: num1 = "2", num2 = "3"
Output: "6"
```

**Example 2:**
```
Input: num1 = "123", num2 = "456"
Output: "56088"
```

**Constraints:**
- `1 <= num1.length, num2.length <= 200`
- `num1` and `num2` consist of digits only.
- `num1` and `num2` don't have any leading zeros except for the zero itself.

## Concept Overview

This problem involves multiplying two large integers represented as strings. The key insight is to implement the standard multiplication algorithm that we learn in elementary school, where we multiply each digit of the second number with the first number and add the results.

## Solutions

### 1. Best Optimized Solution - Elementary School Multiplication

Implement the standard multiplication algorithm that we learn in elementary school.

```python
def multiply(num1, num2):
    if num1 == "0" or num2 == "0":
        return "0"
    
    # Initialize the result array with zeros
    m, n = len(num1), len(num2)
    result = [0] * (m + n)
    
    # Multiply each digit and add to the result
    for i in range(m - 1, -1, -1):
        for j in range(n - 1, -1, -1):
            # Convert characters to integers
            digit1 = ord(num1[i]) - ord('0')
            digit2 = ord(num2[j]) - ord('0')
            
            # Calculate the product and add to the result
            product = digit1 * digit2
            pos1, pos2 = i + j, i + j + 1
            total = product + result[pos2]
            
            # Update the result array
            result[pos1] += total // 10
            result[pos2] = total % 10
    
    # Convert the result array to a string
    i = 0
    while i < len(result) and result[i] == 0:
        i += 1
    
    return ''.join(map(str, result[i:]))
```

**Time Complexity:** O(m * n) - We iterate through each digit of both numbers.
**Space Complexity:** O(m + n) - We use an array of size m + n to store the result.

### 2. Alternative Solution - Using Built-in Functions

Use the built-in functions to convert strings to integers, multiply them, and convert the result back to a string.

```python
def multiply(num1, num2):
    return str(int(num1) * int(num2))
```

**Time Complexity:** O(m + n) - Converting strings to integers and back takes linear time.
**Space Complexity:** O(m + n) - We store the result as a string.

### 3. Alternative Solution - Karatsuba Algorithm

Use the Karatsuba algorithm to multiply large integers more efficiently.

```python
def multiply(num1, num2):
    if num1 == "0" or num2 == "0":
        return "0"
    
    def karatsuba(x, y):
        if x < 10 or y < 10:
            return x * y
        
        # Calculate the size of the numbers
        n = max(len(str(x)), len(str(y)))
        m = n // 2
        
        # Split the numbers
        power = 10 ** m
        a, b = x // power, x % power
        c, d = y // power, y % power
        
        # Recursive steps
        ac = karatsuba(a, c)
        bd = karatsuba(b, d)
        abcd = karatsuba(a + b, c + d) - ac - bd
        
        # Combine the results
        return ac * (10 ** (2 * m)) + abcd * (10 ** m) + bd
    
    return str(karatsuba(int(num1), int(num2)))
```

**Time Complexity:** O((m + n)^log₂3) ≈ O((m + n)^1.585) - The Karatsuba algorithm has a time complexity of O(n^log₂3) for multiplying two n-digit numbers.
**Space Complexity:** O(m + n) - We store the result as a string.

## Solution Choice and Explanation

The Elementary School Multiplication solution (Solution 1) is the best approach for this problem because:

1. **Efficiency**: It achieves O(m * n) time complexity, which is optimal for this problem when we need to implement the multiplication algorithm from scratch.

2. **No Built-in Functions**: It doesn't rely on built-in functions for large integer multiplication, which might be restricted in an interview setting.

3. **Memory Efficiency**: It uses an array of size m + n to store the result, which is the minimum space required.

The key insight of this approach is to implement the standard multiplication algorithm that we learn in elementary school. We multiply each digit of the second number with the first number, keeping track of the carry, and add the results.

For example, let's trace through the algorithm for num1 = "123", num2 = "456":

1. Initialize result = [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0] (size = 3 + 3 = 6)

2. Multiply each digit of num2 with num1:
   - Multiply 6 (num2[2]) with 123:
     - 6 * 3 = 18, pos1 = 2 + 2 = 4, pos2 = 5
       - result[5] = 18 % 10 = 8, result[4] += 18 // 10 = 1
       - result = [0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 8]
     - 6 * 2 = 12, pos1 = 1 + 2 = 3, pos2 = 4
       - result[4] = 1 + 12 % 10 = 3, result[3] += 12 // 10 = 1
       - result = [0, 0, 0, 1, 3, 8]
     - 6 * 1 = 6, pos1 = 0 + 2 = 2, pos2 = 3
       - result[3] = 1 + 6 % 10 = 7, result[2] += 6 // 10 = 0
       - result = [0, 0, 0, 7, 3, 8]
   
   - Multiply 5 (num2[1]) with 123:
     - 5 * 3 = 15, pos1 = 2 + 1 = 3, pos2 = 4
       - result[4] = 3 + 15 % 10 = 8, result[3] += 15 // 10 = 1 + 7 = 8
       - result = [0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8]
     - 5 * 2 = 10, pos1 = 1 + 1 = 2, pos2 = 3
       - result[3] = 8 + 10 % 10 = 8, result[2] += 10 // 10 = 1
       - result = [0, 0, 1, 8, 8, 8]
     - 5 * 1 = 5, pos1 = 0 + 1 = 1, pos2 = 2
       - result[2] = 1 + 5 % 10 = 6, result[1] += 5 // 10 = 0
       - result = [0, 0, 6, 8, 8, 8]
   
   - Multiply 4 (num2[0]) with 123:
     - 4 * 3 = 12, pos1 = 2 + 0 = 2, pos2 = 3
       - result[3] = 8 + 12 % 10 = 0, result[2] += 12 // 10 = 1 + 6 = 7
       - result = [0, 0, 7, 0, 8, 8]
     - 4 * 2 = 8, pos1 = 1 + 0 = 1, pos2 = 2
       - result[2] = 7 + 8 % 10 = 5, result[1] += 8 // 10 = 0
       - result = [0, 0, 5, 0, 8, 8]
     - 4 * 1 = 4, pos1 = 0 + 0 = 0, pos2 = 1
       - result[1] = 0 + 4 % 10 = 4, result[0] += 4 // 10 = 0
       - result = [0, 4, 5, 0, 8, 8]

3. Convert the result array to a string: "056088"

4. Remove leading zeros: "56088"

The Using Built-in Functions solution (Solution 2) is the simplest but might not be allowed in an interview setting. The Karatsuba Algorithm solution (Solution 3) is more efficient for very large numbers but is more complex and might be overkill for this problem.

In an interview, I would first mention the Elementary School Multiplication solution as the most straightforward approach for this problem, and then discuss the Using Built-in Functions and Karatsuba Algorithm solutions as alternatives if asked for different approaches.
