# Jump Game

## Problem Statement

You are given an integer array `nums`. You are initially positioned at the array's first index, and each element in the array represents your maximum jump length at that position.

Return `true` if you can reach the last index, or `false` otherwise.

**Example 1:**
```
Input: nums = [2,3,1,1,4]
Output: true
Explanation: Jump 1 step from index 0 to 1, then 3 steps to the last index.
```

**Example 2:**
```
Input: nums = [3,2,1,0,4]
Output: false
Explanation: You will always arrive at index 3 no matter what. Its maximum jump length is 0, which makes it impossible to reach the last index.
```

**Constraints:**
- `1 <= nums.length <= 10^4`
- `0 <= nums[i] <= 10^5`

## Concept Overview

This problem can be solved using a greedy approach. The key insight is to keep track of the furthest position we can reach from the current position and update it as we iterate through the array.

## Solutions

### 1. Best Optimized Solution - Greedy Approach

Use a greedy approach to determine if we can reach the last index.

```python
def canJump(nums):
    n = len(nums)
    
    # The furthest position we can reach
    furthest = 0
    
    # Iterate through the array
    for i in range(n):
        # If we can't reach the current position, return False
        if i > furthest:
            return False
        
        # Update the furthest position we can reach
        furthest = max(furthest, i + nums[i])
        
        # If we can reach the last index, return True
        if furthest >= n - 1:
            return True
    
    return True  # This line is actually unreachable
```

**Time Complexity:** O(n) - We iterate through the array once.
**Space Complexity:** O(1) - We only use a constant amount of extra space.

### 2. Alternative Solution - Greedy Approach from the End

Use a greedy approach starting from the end of the array.

```python
def canJump(nums):
    n = len(nums)
    
    # The last position we need to reach
    last_pos = n - 1
    
    # Iterate through the array from right to left
    for i in range(n - 2, -1, -1):
        # If we can reach the last position from the current position, update the last position
        if i + nums[i] >= last_pos:
            last_pos = i
    
    # If the last position is 0, we can reach the end
    return last_pos == 0
```

**Time Complexity:** O(n) - We iterate through the array once.
**Space Complexity:** O(1) - We only use a constant amount of extra space.

### 3. Alternative Solution - Dynamic Programming

Use dynamic programming to determine if we can reach the last index.

```python
def canJump(nums):
    n = len(nums)
    
    # dp[i] represents whether we can reach the last index from position i
    dp = [False] * n
    dp[n - 1] = True
    
    # Fill the dp array from right to left
    for i in range(n - 2, -1, -1):
        # Try all possible jumps from position i
        for j in range(1, nums[i] + 1):
            if i + j < n and dp[i + j]:
                dp[i] = True
                break
    
    return dp[0]
```

**Time Complexity:** O(n^2) - In the worst case, we need to check all possible jumps for each position.
**Space Complexity:** O(n) - We use an array of size n to store whether we can reach the last index from each position.

## Solution Choice and Explanation

The Greedy Approach solution (Solution 1) is the best approach for this problem because:

1. **Efficiency**: It achieves O(n) time complexity, which is optimal for this problem, and the space complexity is O(1).

2. **Simplicity**: It's the most straightforward and elegant solution, requiring only a few lines of code.

3. **Intuitiveness**: It naturally maps to the concept of determining if we can reach the last index.

The key insight of this approach is to keep track of the furthest position we can reach from the current position and update it as we iterate through the array. If at any point we can't reach the current position, we return False. If we can reach the last index, we return True.

For example, let's trace through the algorithm for nums = [2, 3, 1, 1, 4]:

1. Initialize furthest = 0
2. For i = 0 (nums[0] = 2):
   - i <= furthest, so continue
   - furthest = max(0, 0 + 2) = 2
   - furthest < n - 1, so continue
3. For i = 1 (nums[1] = 3):
   - i <= furthest, so continue
   - furthest = max(2, 1 + 3) = 4
   - furthest >= n - 1, so return True

For nums = [3, 2, 1, 0, 4]:

1. Initialize furthest = 0
2. For i = 0 (nums[0] = 3):
   - i <= furthest, so continue
   - furthest = max(0, 0 + 3) = 3
   - furthest < n - 1, so continue
3. For i = 1 (nums[1] = 2):
   - i <= furthest, so continue
   - furthest = max(3, 1 + 2) = 3
   - furthest < n - 1, so continue
4. For i = 2 (nums[2] = 1):
   - i <= furthest, so continue
   - furthest = max(3, 2 + 1) = 3
   - furthest < n - 1, so continue
5. For i = 3 (nums[3] = 0):
   - i <= furthest, so continue
   - furthest = max(3, 3 + 0) = 3
   - furthest < n - 1, so continue
6. For i = 4 (nums[4] = 4):
   - i > furthest, so return False

The Greedy Approach from the End solution (Solution 2) is also efficient and may be more intuitive for some people. The Dynamic Programming solution (Solution 3) is less efficient but may be a good starting point for understanding the problem.

In an interview, I would first mention the Greedy Approach solution as the most efficient approach for this problem, and then discuss the Greedy Approach from the End and Dynamic Programming solutions as alternatives if asked for different approaches.
