# Merge Triplets to Form Target Triplet

## Problem Statement

A triplet is an array of three integers. You are given a 2D integer array `triplets`, where `triplets[i] = [ai, bi, ci]` describes the `i`th triplet. You are also given an integer array `target = [x, y, z]` that describes the triplet you want to obtain.

To obtain `target`, you may apply the following operation on `triplets` any number of times:
- Choose two indices (0-indexed) `i` and `j` (`i != j`) and update `triplets[j]` to become `[max(ai, aj), max(bi, bj), max(ci, cj)]`.
  - For example, if `triplets[i] = [2, 5, 3]` and `triplets[j] = [1, 7, 5]`, `triplets[j]` will be updated to `[max(2, 1), max(5, 7), max(3, 5)] = [2, 7, 5]`.

Return `true` if it is possible to obtain the `target` triplet `[x, y, z]` as an element of `triplets`, or `false` otherwise.

**Example 1:**
```
Input: triplets = [[2,5,3],[1,8,4],[1,7,5]], target = [2,7,5]
Output: true
Explanation: Perform the following operations:
- Choose the first and last triplets [[2,5,3],[1,8,4],[1,7,5]]. Update the last triplet to [max(2,1), max(5,7), max(3,5)] = [2,7,5]. triplets = [[2,5,3],[1,8,4],[2,7,5]]
The target triplet [2,7,5] is now an element of triplets.
```

**Example 2:**
```
Input: triplets = [[3,4,5],[4,5,6]], target = [3,2,5]
Output: false
Explanation: It is impossible to have [3,2,5] as an element because there is no 2 in any of the triplets.
```

**Example 3:**
```
Input: triplets = [[2,5,3],[2,3,4],[1,2,5],[5,2,3]], target = [5,5,5]
Output: true
Explanation: Perform the following operations:
- Choose the first and third triplets [[2,5,3],[2,3,4],[1,2,5],[5,2,3]]. Update the third triplet to [max(2,1), max(5,2), max(3,5)] = [2,5,5]. triplets = [[2,5,3],[2,3,4],[2,5,5],[5,2,3]]
- Choose the third and fourth triplets [[2,5,3],[2,3,4],[2,5,5],[5,2,3]]. Update the fourth triplet to [max(2,5), max(5,2), max(5,3)] = [5,5,5]. triplets = [[2,5,3],[2,3,4],[2,5,5],[5,5,5]]
The target triplet [5,5,5] is now an element of triplets.
```

**Constraints:**
- `1 <= triplets.length <= 10^5`
- `triplets[i].length == target.length == 3`
- `1 <= ai, bi, ci, x, y, z <= 1000`

## Concept Overview

This problem can be solved using a greedy approach. The key insight is to identify which triplets can contribute to forming the target triplet. A triplet can contribute if none of its elements exceed the corresponding elements in the target triplet.

## Solutions

### 1. Best Optimized Solution - Greedy Approach

Use a greedy approach to determine if it's possible to obtain the target triplet.

```python
def mergeTriplets(triplets, target):
    # Initialize a set to keep track of the indices that can be matched
    good = set()
    
    # Iterate through the triplets
    for i, (a, b, c) in enumerate(triplets):
        # If any element in the triplet exceeds the corresponding element in the target,
        # we can't use this triplet
        if a > target[0] or b > target[1] or c > target[2]:
            continue
        
        # Otherwise, mark the indices where the triplet matches the target
        if a == target[0]:
            good.add(0)
        if b == target[1]:
            good.add(1)
        if c == target[2]:
            good.add(2)
    
    # If all indices are matched, we can obtain the target triplet
    return len(good) == 3
```

**Time Complexity:** O(n) - We iterate through the triplets once.
**Space Complexity:** O(1) - We use a set of constant size to keep track of the matched indices.

### 2. Alternative Solution - Greedy Approach with Filtering

Use a greedy approach with filtering to determine if it's possible to obtain the target triplet.

```python
def mergeTriplets(triplets, target):
    # Filter out triplets that have any element exceeding the corresponding element in the target
    good_triplets = [triplet for triplet in triplets if all(triplet[i] <= target[i] for i in range(3))]
    
    # Check if we can match each element of the target
    return (
        any(triplet[0] == target[0] for triplet in good_triplets) and
        any(triplet[1] == target[1] for triplet in good_triplets) and
        any(triplet[2] == target[2] for triplet in good_triplets)
    )
```

**Time Complexity:** O(n) - We iterate through the triplets once.
**Space Complexity:** O(n) - We create a filtered list of triplets.

### 3. Alternative Solution - Greedy Approach with Maximum Values

Use a greedy approach with maximum values to determine if it's possible to obtain the target triplet.

```python
def mergeTriplets(triplets, target):
    # Initialize the maximum values we can achieve
    max_values = [0, 0, 0]
    
    # Iterate through the triplets
    for a, b, c in triplets:
        # If any element in the triplet exceeds the corresponding element in the target,
        # we can't use this triplet
        if a > target[0] or b > target[1] or c > target[2]:
            continue
        
        # Update the maximum values
        max_values[0] = max(max_values[0], a)
        max_values[1] = max(max_values[1], b)
        max_values[2] = max(max_values[2], c)
    
    # Check if we can match the target
    return max_values == target
```

**Time Complexity:** O(n) - We iterate through the triplets once.
**Space Complexity:** O(1) - We use an array of constant size to keep track of the maximum values.

## Solution Choice and Explanation

The Greedy Approach solution (Solution 1) is the best approach for this problem because:

1. **Efficiency**: It achieves O(n) time complexity, which is optimal for this problem, and the space complexity is O(1).

2. **Simplicity**: It's the most straightforward and elegant solution, requiring only a few lines of code.

3. **Intuitiveness**: It naturally maps to the concept of determining if it's possible to obtain the target triplet.

The key insight of this approach is to identify which triplets can contribute to forming the target triplet. A triplet can contribute if none of its elements exceed the corresponding elements in the target triplet. We keep track of which indices of the target triplet can be matched and check if all indices can be matched.

For example, let's trace through the algorithm for triplets = [[2,5,3],[1,8,4],[1,7,5]] and target = [2,7,5]:

1. Initialize good = set()

2. Iterate through the triplets:
   - triplet = [2, 5, 3]:
     - 2 <= 2, 5 <= 7, 3 <= 5, so we can use this triplet
     - 2 == 2, so add 0 to good: good = {0}
     - 5 != 7, so don't add 1 to good
     - 3 != 5, so don't add 2 to good
   - triplet = [1, 8, 4]:
     - 1 <= 2, 8 > 7, so we can't use this triplet
   - triplet = [1, 7, 5]:
     - 1 <= 2, 7 <= 7, 5 <= 5, so we can use this triplet
     - 1 != 2, so don't add 0 to good
     - 7 == 7, so add 1 to good: good = {0, 1}
     - 5 == 5, so add 2 to good: good = {0, 1, 2}

3. Check if all indices are matched:
   - len(good) = 3 == 3, so return True

For triplets = [[3,4,5],[4,5,6]] and target = [3,2,5]:

1. Initialize good = set()

2. Iterate through the triplets:
   - triplet = [3, 4, 5]:
     - 3 <= 3, 4 > 2, so we can't use this triplet
   - triplet = [4, 5, 6]:
     - 4 > 3, so we can't use this triplet

3. Check if all indices are matched:
   - len(good) = 0 != 3, so return False

For triplets = [[2,5,3],[2,3,4],[1,2,5],[5,2,3]] and target = [5,5,5]:

1. Initialize good = set()

2. Iterate through the triplets:
   - triplet = [2, 5, 3]:
     - 2 <= 5, 5 <= 5, 3 <= 5, so we can use this triplet
     - 2 != 5, so don't add 0 to good
     - 5 == 5, so add 1 to good: good = {1}
     - 3 != 5, so don't add 2 to good
   - triplet = [2, 3, 4]:
     - 2 <= 5, 3 <= 5, 4 <= 5, so we can use this triplet
     - 2 != 5, so don't add 0 to good
     - 3 != 5, so don't add 1 to good
     - 4 != 5, so don't add 2 to good
   - triplet = [1, 2, 5]:
     - 1 <= 5, 2 <= 5, 5 <= 5, so we can use this triplet
     - 1 != 5, so don't add 0 to good
     - 2 != 5, so don't add 1 to good
     - 5 == 5, so add 2 to good: good = {1, 2}
   - triplet = [5, 2, 3]:
     - 5 <= 5, 2 <= 5, 3 <= 5, so we can use this triplet
     - 5 == 5, so add 0 to good: good = {0, 1, 2}

3. Check if all indices are matched:
   - len(good) = 3 == 3, so return True

The Greedy Approach with Filtering solution (Solution 2) is also efficient but uses more space. The Greedy Approach with Maximum Values solution (Solution 3) is also efficient and may be more intuitive for some people.

In an interview, I would first mention the Greedy Approach solution as the most efficient approach for this problem, and then discuss the Greedy Approach with Filtering and Greedy Approach with Maximum Values solutions as alternatives if asked for different approaches.
