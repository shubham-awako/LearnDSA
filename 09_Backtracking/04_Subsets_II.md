# Subsets II

## Problem Statement

Given an integer array `nums` that may contain duplicates, return all possible subsets (the power set).

The solution set must not contain duplicate subsets. Return the solution in any order.

**Example 1:**
```
Input: nums = [1,2,2]
Output: [[],[1],[1,2],[1,2,2],[2],[2,2]]
```

**Example 2:**
```
Input: nums = [0]
Output: [[],[0]]
```

**Constraints:**
- `1 <= nums.length <= 10`
- `-10 <= nums[i] <= 10`

## Concept Overview

This problem is an extension of the Subsets problem, but with the added complexity of handling duplicate elements. The key insight is to sort the array first and then use backtracking to generate all possible subsets, skipping duplicate elements at the same level of recursion to avoid duplicate subsets.

## Solutions

### 1. Best Optimized Solution - Backtracking with Sorting

Sort the array first and then use backtracking to generate all possible subsets, skipping duplicate elements at the same level of recursion.

```python
def subsetsWithDup(nums):
    # Sort the array to handle duplicates
    nums.sort()
    result = []
    
    def backtrack(start, current):
        # Add the current subset to the result
        result.append(current[:])
        
        # Try to include each remaining element in the subset
        for i in range(start, len(nums)):
            # Skip duplicates at the same level of recursion
            if i > start and nums[i] == nums[i-1]:
                continue
            
            # Include the current element
            current.append(nums[i])
            
            # Recursively generate subsets with the current element included
            backtrack(i + 1, current)
            
            # Exclude the current element (backtrack)
            current.pop()
    
    backtrack(0, [])
    return result
```

**Time Complexity:** O(n * 2^n) - There are 2^n possible subsets, and it takes O(n) time to copy each subset. The sorting step takes O(n log n) time, which is dominated by the backtracking step.
**Space Complexity:** O(n) - The recursion stack can go up to n levels deep, and we need O(n) space to store each subset.

### 2. Alternative Solution - Iterative

Use an iterative approach to generate all possible subsets, handling duplicates by keeping track of the starting index for each new element.

```python
def subsetsWithDup(nums):
    # Sort the array to handle duplicates
    nums.sort()
    result = [[]]
    
    start = 0
    for i in range(len(nums)):
        # If the current element is a duplicate, start from the subsets added in the previous iteration
        if i > 0 and nums[i] == nums[i-1]:
            start = end
        
        # Save the current size of the result
        end = len(result)
        
        # For each existing subset, create a new subset by adding the current element
        for j in range(start, end):
            result.append(result[j] + [nums[i]])
        
        # Update the starting index for the next iteration
        start = end
    
    return result
```

**Time Complexity:** O(n * 2^n) - There are 2^n possible subsets, and it takes O(n) time to copy each subset. The sorting step takes O(n log n) time, which is dominated by the subset generation step.
**Space Complexity:** O(n * 2^n) - We store all subsets, each of which can have up to n elements.

### 3. Alternative Solution - Bit Manipulation

Use bit manipulation to generate all possible subsets, handling duplicates by checking if the subset has already been added to the result.

```python
def subsetsWithDup(nums):
    # Sort the array to handle duplicates
    nums.sort()
    n = len(nums)
    result = []
    seen = set()
    
    # There are 2^n possible subsets
    for i in range(1 << n):
        subset = []
        
        # Check each bit of i
        for j in range(n):
            # If the jth bit is set, include the jth element
            if i & (1 << j):
                subset.append(nums[j])
        
        # Convert the subset to a tuple to make it hashable
        subset_tuple = tuple(subset)
        
        # Add the subset to the result if it hasn't been seen before
        if subset_tuple not in seen:
            seen.add(subset_tuple)
            result.append(subset)
    
    return result
```

**Time Complexity:** O(n * 2^n) - There are 2^n possible subsets, and it takes O(n) time to generate each subset. The sorting step takes O(n log n) time, which is dominated by the subset generation step.
**Space Complexity:** O(n * 2^n) - We store all subsets, each of which can have up to n elements.

## Solution Choice and Explanation

The backtracking with sorting solution (Solution 1) is the best approach for this problem because:

1. **Efficiency**: It avoids generating duplicate subsets by skipping duplicate elements at the same level of recursion.

2. **Clarity**: It clearly expresses the recursive nature of the problem and is easy to understand.

3. **Space Efficiency**: It uses less space than the iterative and bit manipulation solutions because it only keeps track of the current subset during the recursion.

The key insight of this approach is to sort the array first and then use backtracking to generate all possible subsets, skipping duplicate elements at the same level of recursion to avoid duplicate subsets. We use a recursive function `backtrack(start, current)` that:
1. Adds the current subset to the result.
2. Tries to include each remaining element in the subset, skipping duplicates at the same level of recursion.
3. Recursively generates subsets with the current element included.
4. Excludes the current element (backtracking) to try other combinations.

For example, let's trace through the algorithm for nums = [1, 2, 2]:
1. Sort the array: nums = [1, 2, 2]
2. Start with an empty subset: []
3. Add it to the result: [[]]
4. Try to include 1:
   - Current subset: [1]
   - Add it to the result: [[], [1]]
   - Try to include 2:
     - Current subset: [1, 2]
     - Add it to the result: [[], [1], [1, 2]]
     - Try to include 2:
       - Current subset: [1, 2, 2]
       - Add it to the result: [[], [1], [1, 2], [1, 2, 2]]
       - No more elements to include, backtrack.
     - Exclude 2, backtrack.
   - Exclude 1, backtrack.
5. Try to include 2:
   - Current subset: [2]
   - Add it to the result: [[], [1], [1, 2], [1, 2, 2], [2]]
   - Try to include 2:
     - Current subset: [2, 2]
     - Add it to the result: [[], [1], [1, 2], [1, 2, 2], [2], [2, 2]]
     - No more elements to include, backtrack.
   - Exclude 2, backtrack.
6. Try to include the second 2:
   - This is a duplicate at the same level of recursion, so skip it.
7. No more elements to include, we're done.
8. Final result: [[], [1], [1, 2], [1, 2, 2], [2], [2, 2]]

The iterative solution (Solution 2) is also efficient but less intuitive. The bit manipulation solution (Solution 3) is elegant but less efficient for handling duplicates.

In an interview, I would first mention the backtracking with sorting solution as the most efficient approach for this problem, and then mention the iterative and bit manipulation solutions as alternatives if asked for different approaches.
