# Serialize and Deserialize Binary Tree

## Problem Statement

Serialization is the process of converting a data structure or object into a sequence of bits so that it can be stored in a file or memory buffer, or transmitted across a network connection link to be reconstructed later in the same or another computer environment.

Design an algorithm to serialize and deserialize a binary tree. There is no restriction on how your serialization/deserialization algorithm should work. You just need to ensure that a binary tree can be serialized to a string and this string can be deserialized to the original tree structure.

**Clarification:** The input/output format is the same as how LeetCode serializes a binary tree. You do not necessarily need to follow this format, so please be creative and come up with different approaches yourself.

**Example 1:**
```
Input: root = [1,2,3,null,null,4,5]
Output: [1,2,3,null,null,4,5]
```

**Example 2:**
```
Input: root = []
Output: []
```

**Constraints:**
- The number of nodes in the tree is in the range `[0, 10^4]`.
- `-1000 <= Node.val <= 1000`

## Concept Overview

This problem tests your understanding of tree traversal and string manipulation. The key insight is to use a traversal algorithm (like preorder, level-order, etc.) to serialize the tree and then use the same algorithm to deserialize it.

## Solutions

### 1. Best Optimized Solution - Preorder Traversal with Null Markers

Use preorder traversal to serialize the tree and use the same traversal to deserialize it.

```python
# Definition for a binary tree node.
# class TreeNode:
#     def __init__(self, val=0, left=None, right=None):
#         self.val = val
#         self.left = left
#         self.right = right

class Codec:
    def serialize(self, root):
        """Encodes a tree to a single string.
        
        :type root: TreeNode
        :rtype: str
        """
        result = []
        
        def preorder(node):
            if not node:
                result.append("null")
                return
            
            result.append(str(node.val))
            preorder(node.left)
            preorder(node.right)
        
        preorder(root)
        return ",".join(result)

    def deserialize(self, data):
        """Decodes your encoded data to tree.
        
        :type data: str
        :rtype: TreeNode
        """
        values = data.split(",")
        self.index = 0
        
        def build_tree():
            if self.index >= len(values) or values[self.index] == "null":
                self.index += 1
                return None
            
            node = TreeNode(int(values[self.index]))
            self.index += 1
            node.left = build_tree()
            node.right = build_tree()
            
            return node
        
        return build_tree()
```

**Time Complexity:**
- Serialize: O(n) - We visit each node once.
- Deserialize: O(n) - We process each value once.

**Space Complexity:**
- Serialize: O(n) - We store the serialized string.
- Deserialize: O(n) - We store the deserialized tree and the recursion stack can go up to h levels deep, where h is the height of the tree. In the worst case, h = n for a skewed tree.

### 2. Alternative Solution - Level-Order Traversal

Use level-order traversal to serialize the tree and use the same traversal to deserialize it.

```python
from collections import deque

# Definition for a binary tree node.
# class TreeNode:
#     def __init__(self, val=0, left=None, right=None):
#         self.val = val
#         self.left = left
#         self.right = right

class Codec:
    def serialize(self, root):
        """Encodes a tree to a single string.
        
        :type root: TreeNode
        :rtype: str
        """
        if not root:
            return ""
        
        result = []
        queue = deque([root])
        
        while queue:
            node = queue.popleft()
            
            if node:
                result.append(str(node.val))
                queue.append(node.left)
                queue.append(node.right)
            else:
                result.append("null")
        
        # Remove trailing nulls
        while result and result[-1] == "null":
            result.pop()
        
        return ",".join(result)

    def deserialize(self, data):
        """Decodes your encoded data to tree.
        
        :type data: str
        :rtype: TreeNode
        """
        if not data:
            return None
        
        values = data.split(",")
        root = TreeNode(int(values[0]))
        queue = deque([root])
        i = 1
        
        while queue and i < len(values):
            node = queue.popleft()
            
            # Left child
            if i < len(values) and values[i] != "null":
                node.left = TreeNode(int(values[i]))
                queue.append(node.left)
            i += 1
            
            # Right child
            if i < len(values) and values[i] != "null":
                node.right = TreeNode(int(values[i]))
                queue.append(node.right)
            i += 1
        
        return root
```

**Time Complexity:**
- Serialize: O(n) - We visit each node once.
- Deserialize: O(n) - We process each value once.

**Space Complexity:**
- Serialize: O(n) - We store the serialized string.
- Deserialize: O(n) - We store the deserialized tree and the queue can contain at most w nodes, where w is the maximum width of the tree. In the worst case, w = n/2 for a complete binary tree.

### 3. Alternative Solution - Custom Format with DFS

Use a custom format to serialize the tree and use DFS to deserialize it.

```python
# Definition for a binary tree node.
# class TreeNode:
#     def __init__(self, val=0, left=None, right=None):
#         self.val = val
#         self.left = left
#         self.right = right

class Codec:
    def serialize(self, root):
        """Encodes a tree to a single string.
        
        :type root: TreeNode
        :rtype: str
        """
        if not root:
            return "#"
        
        # Use a custom format: val(left)(right)
        return str(root.val) + "(" + self.serialize(root.left) + ")(" + self.serialize(root.right) + ")"

    def deserialize(self, data):
        """Decodes your encoded data to tree.
        
        :type data: str
        :rtype: TreeNode
        """
        if data == "#":
            return None
        
        # Find the root value
        i = 0
        while i < len(data) and data[i] not in "()":
            i += 1
        
        root = TreeNode(int(data[:i]))
        
        # Find the left subtree
        balance = 0
        j = i
        while j < len(data):
            if data[j] == "(":
                balance += 1
            elif data[j] == ")":
                balance -= 1
                if balance == 0:
                    break
            j += 1
        
        # Deserialize the left subtree
        root.left = self.deserialize(data[i+1:j])
        
        # Deserialize the right subtree
        root.right = self.deserialize(data[j+2:-1])
        
        return root
```

**Time Complexity:**
- Serialize: O(n) - We visit each node once.
- Deserialize: O(n^2) - In the worst case, we need to scan the entire string for each node.

**Space Complexity:**
- Serialize: O(n) - We store the serialized string.
- Deserialize: O(n) - We store the deserialized tree and the recursion stack can go up to h levels deep, where h is the height of the tree. In the worst case, h = n for a skewed tree.

## Solution Choice and Explanation

The preorder traversal with null markers solution (Solution 1) is the best solution for this problem because:

1. **Simplicity**: It's straightforward to implement and understand.

2. **Efficiency**: It achieves O(n) time complexity for both serialization and deserialization.

3. **Space Efficiency**: It uses O(n) space, which is optimal for this problem.

The key insight of this approach is to use preorder traversal to serialize the tree and use the same traversal to deserialize it. For serialization, we:
1. Perform a preorder traversal of the tree.
2. For each node, append its value to the result.
3. For null nodes, append "null" to the result.
4. Join the result with commas to form the serialized string.

For deserialization, we:
1. Split the serialized string by commas to get the values.
2. Use a recursive function to build the tree in preorder.
3. For each value, if it's "null", return null; otherwise, create a node with the value and recursively build its left and right subtrees.

For example, let's serialize and deserialize the tree [1,2,3,null,null,4,5]:
```
    1
   / \
  2   3
     / \
    4   5
```

Serialization:
1. Preorder traversal: 1,2,null,null,3,4,null,null,5,null,null
2. Join with commas: "1,2,null,null,3,4,null,null,5,null,null"

Deserialization:
1. Split by commas: ["1", "2", "null", "null", "3", "4", "null", "null", "5", "null", "null"]
2. Build the tree in preorder:
   - Create node 1
   - Recursively build the left subtree of 1:
     - Create node 2
     - Recursively build the left subtree of 2: null
     - Recursively build the right subtree of 2: null
   - Recursively build the right subtree of 1:
     - Create node 3
     - Recursively build the left subtree of 3:
       - Create node 4
       - Recursively build the left subtree of 4: null
       - Recursively build the right subtree of 4: null
     - Recursively build the right subtree of 3:
       - Create node 5
       - Recursively build the left subtree of 5: null
       - Recursively build the right subtree of 5: null
3. Return the root node 1

The level-order traversal solution (Solution 2) is also efficient but slightly more complex. The custom format solution (Solution 3) is elegant but less efficient for deserialization.

In an interview, I would first mention the preorder traversal with null markers solution as the most straightforward and efficient solution for this problem.
