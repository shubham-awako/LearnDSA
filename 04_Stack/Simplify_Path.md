# Simplify Path

## Problem Statement

Given a string `path`, which is an absolute path (starting with a slash '/') to a file or directory in a Unix-style file system, convert it to the simplified canonical path.

In a Unix-style file system, a period '.' refers to the current directory, a double period '..' refers to the directory up a level, and any multiple consecutive slashes (i.e. '//') are treated as a single slash '/'. For this problem, any other format of periods such as '...' are treated as file/directory names.

The canonical path should have the following format:
- The path starts with a single slash '/'.
- Any two directories are separated by a single slash '/'.
- The path does not end with a trailing '/'.
- The path only contains the directories on the path from the root directory to the target file or directory (i.e., no period '.' or double period '..')

Return the simplified canonical path.

**Example 1:**
```
Input: path = "/home/"
Output: "/home"
Explanation: Note that there is no trailing slash after the last directory name.
```

**Example 2:**
```
Input: path = "/../"
Output: "/"
Explanation: Going one level up from the root directory is a no-op, as the root level is the highest level you can go.
```

**Example 3:**
```
Input: path = "/home//foo/"
Output: "/home/foo"
Explanation: In the canonical path, multiple consecutive slashes are replaced by a single one.
```

**Constraints:**
- `1 <= path.length <= 3000`
- `path` consists of English letters, digits, period '.', slash '/' or '_'.
- `path` is a valid absolute path.

## Concept Overview

This problem tests your understanding of stack operations for parsing and simplifying file paths. The key insight is to use a stack to keep track of directories and handle special cases like '.' and '..'.

## Solutions

### 1. Best Optimized Solution - Stack

Use a stack to keep track of directories and handle special cases.

```python
def simplifyPath(path):
    stack = []
    
    # Split the path by '/'
    components = path.split('/')
    
    for component in components:
        # Ignore empty components and '.'
        if component == '' or component == '.':
            continue
        
        # Handle '..' by popping from the stack
        elif component == '..':
            if stack:
                stack.pop()
        
        # Add valid directory names to the stack
        else:
            stack.append(component)
    
    # Construct the canonical path
    return '/' + '/'.join(stack)
```

**Time Complexity:** O(n) - We iterate through the path once.
**Space Complexity:** O(n) - For storing the stack and the components.

### 2. Alternative Solution - String Manipulation

Use string manipulation to simplify the path.

```python
def simplifyPath(path):
    # Split the path by '/'
    components = path.split('/')
    
    # Filter out empty components and '.'
    filtered = []
    for component in components:
        if component and component != '.':
            filtered.append(component)
    
    # Handle '..'
    result = []
    for component in filtered:
        if component == '..':
            if result:
                result.pop()
        else:
            result.append(component)
    
    # Construct the canonical path
    return '/' + '/'.join(result)
```

**Time Complexity:** O(n) - We iterate through the path once.
**Space Complexity:** O(n) - For storing the components and the result.

### 3. Alternative Solution - Regular Expression

Use regular expressions to simplify the path.

```python
import re

def simplifyPath(path):
    # Replace multiple consecutive slashes with a single slash
    path = re.sub('/+', '/', path)
    
    # Split the path by '/'
    components = path.split('/')
    
    # Filter out empty components and '.'
    filtered = [component for component in components if component and component != '.']
    
    # Handle '..'
    result = []
    for component in filtered:
        if component == '..':
            if result:
                result.pop()
        else:
            result.append(component)
    
    # Construct the canonical path
    return '/' + '/'.join(result)
```

**Time Complexity:** O(n) - We iterate through the path once.
**Space Complexity:** O(n) - For storing the components and the result.

## Solution Choice and Explanation

The stack solution (Solution 1) is the best approach for this problem because:

1. **Simplicity**: It's straightforward to implement and understand.

2. **Optimal Time Complexity**: It achieves O(n) time complexity, which is optimal for this problem.

3. **Natural Fit**: The problem is naturally modeled as a stack, where we push directory names and pop when we encounter '..'.

The key insight of this approach is to use a stack to keep track of directories. We split the path by '/' and process each component:
- If the component is empty or '.', we ignore it.
- If the component is '..', we pop from the stack to go up one level.
- Otherwise, we push the component onto the stack as a valid directory name.

Finally, we construct the canonical path by joining the stack elements with '/'.

For example, let's simplify "/home//foo/":
1. Split by '/': ['', 'home', '', 'foo', '']
2. Process components:
   - '': Ignore
   - 'home': Push onto the stack. stack = ['home']
   - '': Ignore
   - 'foo': Push onto the stack. stack = ['home', 'foo']
   - '': Ignore
3. Construct the canonical path: '/' + 'home/foo' = '/home/foo'

The string manipulation approach (Solution 2) is essentially the same as the stack solution but with different variable names. The regular expression approach (Solution 3) adds unnecessary complexity for this problem.

In an interview, I would first mention the stack approach as the most natural and efficient solution for this problem.
