# Encode and Decode Strings

## Problem Statement

Design an algorithm to encode a list of strings to a string. The encoded string is then sent over the network and is decoded back to the original list of strings.

Implement the `encode` and `decode` methods:
- `encode(strs)`: Encodes a list of strings to a single string.
- `decode(s)`: Decodes a single string to a list of strings.

**Example 1:**
```
Input: strs = ["Hello","World"]
Output: ["Hello","World"]
Explanation:
Machine 1:
Codec encoder = new Codec();
String encodedString = encoder.encode(strs);
Machine 2:
Codec decoder = new Codec();
String[] decodedStrs = decoder.decode(encodedString);
// decodedStrs = ["Hello","World"];
```

**Example 2:**
```
Input: strs = [""]
Output: [""]
```

**Constraints:**
- `1 <= strs.length <= 200`
- `0 <= strs[i].length <= 200`
- `strs[i]` contains any possible characters out of 256 valid ASCII characters.

## Concept Overview

This problem asks us to design a way to encode and decode a list of strings. The challenge is to handle strings that may contain any character, including delimiters that we might want to use for separation.

## Solutions

### 1. Brute Force Approach - Using a Special Delimiter

Use a special delimiter to separate strings, assuming the delimiter doesn't appear in the strings.

```python
class Codec:
    def encode(self, strs):
        """Encodes a list of strings to a single string.
        
        :type strs: List[str]
        :rtype: str
        """
        return "###".join(strs)
        
    def decode(self, s):
        """Decodes a single string to a list of strings.
        
        :type s: str
        :rtype: List[str]
        """
        return s.split("###")
```

**Time Complexity:** 
- Encode: O(n) where n is the total length of all strings.
- Decode: O(n) where n is the length of the encoded string.

**Space Complexity:** O(n) for both encode and decode.

**Problem**: This approach fails if the strings contain the delimiter.

### 2. Improved Solution - Length Prefixing

Prefix each string with its length followed by a delimiter.

```python
class Codec:
    def encode(self, strs):
        """Encodes a list of strings to a single string.
        
        :type strs: List[str]
        :rtype: str
        """
        encoded = ""
        for s in strs:
            encoded += str(len(s)) + "#" + s
        return encoded
        
    def decode(self, s):
        """Decodes a single string to a list of strings.
        
        :type s: str
        :rtype: List[str]
        """
        decoded = []
        i = 0
        while i < len(s):
            # Find the position of the delimiter
            j = i
            while s[j] != '#':
                j += 1
            
            # Extract the length
            length = int(s[i:j])
            
            # Extract the string
            decoded.append(s[j+1:j+1+length])
            
            # Move to the next string
            i = j + 1 + length
            
        return decoded
```

**Time Complexity:** 
- Encode: O(n) where n is the total length of all strings.
- Decode: O(n) where n is the length of the encoded string.

**Space Complexity:** O(n) for both encode and decode.

### 3. Best Optimized Solution - Chunk Transfer Encoding

Use a more robust encoding scheme similar to HTTP chunk transfer encoding.

```python
class Codec:
    def encode(self, strs):
        """Encodes a list of strings to a single string.
        
        :type strs: List[str]
        :rtype: str
        """
        # Format: [length]:[string]
        return ''.join(f"{len(s)}:{s}" for s in strs)
        
    def decode(self, s):
        """Decodes a single string to a list of strings.
        
        :type s: str
        :rtype: List[str]
        """
        decoded = []
        i = 0
        
        while i < len(s):
            # Find the colon separator
            j = s.find(':', i)
            
            # Extract the length
            length = int(s[i:j])
            
            # Extract the string
            decoded.append(s[j+1:j+1+length])
            
            # Move to the next string
            i = j + 1 + length
            
        return decoded
```

**Time Complexity:** 
- Encode: O(n) where n is the total length of all strings.
- Decode: O(n) where n is the length of the encoded string.

**Space Complexity:** O(n) for both encode and decode.

### 4. Alternative Solution - Non-ASCII Delimiter

Use a character that is guaranteed not to appear in the input strings (e.g., a non-ASCII character).

```python
class Codec:
    def encode(self, strs):
        """Encodes a list of strings to a single string.
        
        :type strs: List[str]
        :rtype: str
        """
        # Use a non-ASCII character as delimiter
        return chr(257).join(strs)
        
    def decode(self, s):
        """Decodes a single string to a list of strings.
        
        :type s: str
        :rtype: List[str]
        """
        return s.split(chr(257))
```

**Time Complexity:** 
- Encode: O(n) where n is the total length of all strings.
- Decode: O(n) where n is the length of the encoded string.

**Space Complexity:** O(n) for both encode and decode.

**Problem**: This approach assumes that the strings only contain ASCII characters (0-255), which is mentioned in the constraints.

## Solution Choice and Explanation

The length prefixing solution (Solution 2) or chunk transfer encoding (Solution 3) are the best approaches for this problem because:

1. **Robustness**: They can handle any character in the input strings, including potential delimiters.

2. **Unambiguous Decoding**: The length prefix ensures that we can correctly identify the boundaries of each string.

3. **Efficient**: Both solutions have O(n) time complexity for encoding and decoding.

Between the two, the chunk transfer encoding (Solution 3) is slightly more elegant and easier to understand, as it uses a clear format (`length:string`) that is similar to established protocols like HTTP chunk transfer encoding.

The non-ASCII delimiter approach (Solution 4) is simpler but relies on the assumption that the input strings only contain ASCII characters, which is mentioned in the constraints. However, it's generally less robust than the length prefixing approach.

The brute force approach (Solution 1) is simple but fails if the strings contain the delimiter, making it unsuitable for this problem.

In an interview, I would first mention the challenges of the problem (handling arbitrary characters) and then implement the chunk transfer encoding solution as the most robust and clear approach.
