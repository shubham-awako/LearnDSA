# Product of Array Except Self

## Problem Statement

Given an integer array `nums`, return an array `answer` such that `answer[i]` is equal to the product of all the elements of `nums` except `nums[i]`.

The product of any prefix or suffix of `nums` is guaranteed to fit in a 32-bit integer.

You must write an algorithm running in O(n) time and without using the division operation.

**Example 1:**
```
Input: nums = [1,2,3,4]
Output: [24,12,8,6]
```

**Example 2:**
```
Input: nums = [-1,1,0,-3,3]
Output: [0,0,9,0,0]
```

**Constraints:**
- `2 <= nums.length <= 10^5`
- `-30 <= nums[i] <= 30`
- The product of any prefix or suffix of `nums` is guaranteed to fit in a 32-bit integer.

**Follow up:** Can you solve the problem in O(1) extra space complexity? (The output array does not count as extra space for space complexity analysis.)

## Concept Overview

This problem tests your ability to compute products efficiently without using division. The key insight is to use prefix and suffix products to calculate the result for each position.

## Solutions

### 1. Brute Force Approach

Calculate the product for each position by iterating through the array and multiplying all elements except the current one.

```python
def productExceptSelf(nums):
    n = len(nums)
    answer = [1] * n
    
    for i in range(n):
        for j in range(n):
            if i != j:
                answer[i] *= nums[j]
    
    return answer
```

**Time Complexity:** O(n²) - For each position, we iterate through the array.
**Space Complexity:** O(1) - No extra space is used beyond the output array.

### 2. Improved Solution - Using Division (Not Allowed)

Calculate the product of all elements, then divide by each element to get the result for that position. This approach doesn't work if there are zeros in the array and is not allowed by the problem statement.

```python
def productExceptSelf(nums):
    n = len(nums)
    answer = [1] * n
    
    # Calculate product of all elements
    product = 1
    for num in nums:
        product *= num
    
    # Divide by each element to get the result
    for i in range(n):
        if nums[i] != 0:
            answer[i] = product // nums[i]
        else:
            # Handle zero by calculating product of all other elements
            temp_product = 1
            for j in range(n):
                if j != i:
                    temp_product *= nums[j]
            answer[i] = temp_product
    
    return answer
```

**Time Complexity:** O(n) in general, but O(n²) if there are zeros.
**Space Complexity:** O(1) - No extra space is used beyond the output array.

**Note:** This solution is not valid for this problem as it uses division.

### 3. Best Optimized Solution - Prefix and Suffix Products

Use two passes: one to calculate prefix products and another to calculate suffix products.

```python
def productExceptSelf(nums):
    n = len(nums)
    answer = [1] * n
    
    # Calculate prefix products
    prefix = 1
    for i in range(n):
        answer[i] = prefix
        prefix *= nums[i]
    
    # Calculate suffix products and multiply with prefix products
    suffix = 1
    for i in range(n - 1, -1, -1):
        answer[i] *= suffix
        suffix *= nums[i]
    
    return answer
```

**Time Complexity:** O(n) - We make two passes through the array.
**Space Complexity:** O(1) - No extra space is used beyond the output array.

## Solution Choice and Explanation

The prefix and suffix products solution (Solution 3) is the best approach for this problem because:

1. **Optimal Time Complexity**: It achieves O(n) time complexity, as required by the problem.

2. **No Division**: It doesn't use the division operation, which is a constraint of the problem.

3. **Optimal Space Complexity**: It uses O(1) extra space (not counting the output array), meeting the follow-up challenge.

The key insight of this approach is to break down the product of all elements except the current one into two parts:
- The product of all elements before the current position (prefix product)
- The product of all elements after the current position (suffix product)

For each position i, the result is the product of the prefix product up to i-1 and the suffix product starting from i+1.

The algorithm works in two passes:
1. First pass (left to right): Calculate the prefix product for each position.
2. Second pass (right to left): Calculate the suffix product and multiply it with the prefix product.

This approach elegantly handles zeros in the array without special cases and avoids the use of division.

The brute force approach (Solution 1) is simple but inefficient with O(n²) time complexity.

The division-based approach (Solution 2) is not valid for this problem as it uses division, and it also has issues handling zeros correctly.

In an interview, I would first mention the constraints (no division, O(n) time), then explain the prefix and suffix products approach as the optimal solution that meets all requirements.
