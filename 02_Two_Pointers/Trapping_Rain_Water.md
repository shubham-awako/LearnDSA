# Trapping Rain Water

## Problem Statement

Given `n` non-negative integers representing an elevation map where the width of each bar is 1, compute how much water it can trap after raining.

**Example 1:**
```
Input: height = [0,1,0,2,1,0,1,3,2,1,2,1]
Output: 6
Explanation: The above elevation map (black section) is represented by array [0,1,0,2,1,0,1,3,2,1,2,1]. In this case, 6 units of rain water (blue section) are being trapped.
```

**Example 2:**
```
Input: height = [4,2,0,3,2,5]
Output: 9
```

**Constraints:**
- `n == height.length`
- `1 <= n <= 2 * 10^4`
- `0 <= height[i] <= 10^5`

## Concept Overview

This problem asks us to calculate the amount of water that can be trapped between bars of different heights. The key insight is that the water trapped at each position depends on the minimum of the maximum heights to its left and right.

## Solutions

### 1. Brute Force Approach

For each position, find the maximum height to its left and right, then calculate the water trapped at that position.

```python
def trap(height):
    n = len(height)
    total_water = 0
    
    for i in range(1, n - 1):
        # Find maximum height to the left
        left_max = max(height[:i])
        
        # Find maximum height to the right
        right_max = max(height[i+1:])
        
        # Calculate water trapped at current position
        water = min(left_max, right_max) - height[i]
        
        # Add to total if positive
        if water > 0:
            total_water += water
    
    return total_water
```

**Time Complexity:** O(nÂ²) - For each position, we scan the entire array to find the maximum heights.
**Space Complexity:** O(1) - We use only a few variables regardless of input size.

### 2. Improved Solution - Dynamic Programming

Precompute the maximum heights to the left and right for each position.

```python
def trap(height):
    if not height:
        return 0
    
    n = len(height)
    total_water = 0
    
    # Precompute maximum heights to the left
    left_max = [0] * n
    left_max[0] = height[0]
    for i in range(1, n):
        left_max[i] = max(left_max[i - 1], height[i])
    
    # Precompute maximum heights to the right
    right_max = [0] * n
    right_max[n - 1] = height[n - 1]
    for i in range(n - 2, -1, -1):
        right_max[i] = max(right_max[i + 1], height[i])
    
    # Calculate water trapped at each position
    for i in range(n):
        water = min(left_max[i], right_max[i]) - height[i]
        total_water += water
    
    return total_water
```

**Time Complexity:** O(n) - We make three passes through the array.
**Space Complexity:** O(n) - We use two arrays of size n to store the maximum heights.

### 3. Best Optimized Solution - Two Pointers

Use two pointers to track the maximum heights from both ends and calculate the water trapped in a single pass.

```python
def trap(height):
    if not height:
        return 0
    
    n = len(height)
    total_water = 0
    
    left, right = 0, n - 1
    left_max = right_max = 0
    
    while left < right:
        if height[left] < height[right]:
            if height[left] >= left_max:
                left_max = height[left]
            else:
                total_water += left_max - height[left]
            left += 1
        else:
            if height[right] >= right_max:
                right_max = height[right]
            else:
                total_water += right_max - height[right]
            right -= 1
    
    return total_water
```

**Time Complexity:** O(n) - We process each element at most once.
**Space Complexity:** O(1) - We use only a few variables regardless of input size.

### 4. Alternative Solution - Stack

Use a stack to keep track of bars that can trap water.

```python
def trap(height):
    n = len(height)
    total_water = 0
    stack = []
    
    for i in range(n):
        while stack and height[i] > height[stack[-1]]:
            top = stack.pop()
            
            if not stack:
                break
            
            # Calculate the width of the container
            width = i - stack[-1] - 1
            
            # Calculate the height of the container
            h = min(height[i], height[stack[-1]]) - height[top]
            
            # Add to total water
            total_water += width * h
        
        stack.append(i)
    
    return total_water
```

**Time Complexity:** O(n) - Each bar is pushed and popped at most once.
**Space Complexity:** O(n) - In the worst case, all bars are in the stack.

## Solution Choice and Explanation

The two-pointer solution (Solution 3) is the best approach for this problem because:

1. **Optimal Time Complexity**: It achieves O(n) time complexity with a single pass through the array.

2. **Optimal Space Complexity**: It uses O(1) extra space, which is better than the O(n) space used by the dynamic programming and stack approaches.

3. **Elegant Algorithm**: It efficiently tracks the maximum heights from both ends and calculates the water trapped in a single pass.

The key insight of this approach is to use two pointers starting from opposite ends of the array. At each step, we move the pointer with the smaller height and update the maximum height seen so far from that side. If the current height is less than the maximum height seen so far, we can trap water at that position.

The algorithm works as follows:
1. Initialize two pointers at the start and end of the array.
2. Initialize variables to track the maximum heights seen so far from both sides.
3. While the left pointer is less than the right pointer:
   a. If the height at the left pointer is less than the height at the right pointer, process the left pointer.
   b. Otherwise, process the right pointer.
   c. When processing a pointer, update the maximum height seen so far from that side and calculate the water trapped at that position.

The dynamic programming approach (Solution 2) is also efficient with O(n) time complexity but uses O(n) extra space. The stack approach (Solution 4) is less intuitive but also achieves O(n) time complexity.

In an interview, I would first mention the two-pointer approach as the optimal solution that achieves O(n) time complexity with O(1) extra space. I would also explain the insight behind tracking the maximum heights from both sides.
