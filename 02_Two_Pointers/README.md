# 02. Two Pointers

## Concept Overview

The Two Pointers technique is a pattern where two pointers iterate through a data structure in tandem or in opposite directions to solve a problem with less time and space complexity.

### Key Concepts
- **Same Direction Pointers**: Both pointers move in the same direction but at different speeds (e.g., slow and fast pointers)
- **Opposite Direction Pointers**: Pointers start at opposite ends and move toward each other
- **Window Manipulation**: Adjusting the window size between two pointers to find a desired subarray/substring
- **Partitioning**: Using two pointers to partition an array based on certain conditions

### Common Applications
- Finding pairs in a sorted array with a specific sum
- Detecting cycles in linked lists
- Removing duplicates from sorted arrays
- Reversing arrays or strings in-place
- Three-sum and k-sum problems
- Palindrome verification
- Partitioning arrays (like in quicksort)

### Advantages
- Reduces time complexity (often from O(nÂ²) to O(n))
- Usually requires O(1) extra space
- Works well with sorted arrays and linked lists
