# Palindromic Substrings

## Problem Statement

Given a string `s`, return the number of palindromic substrings in it.

A string is a palindrome when it reads the same backward as forward.

A substring is a contiguous sequence of characters within the string.

**Example 1:**
```
Input: s = "abc"
Output: 3
Explanation: Three palindromic strings: "a", "b", "c".
```

**Example 2:**
```
Input: s = "aaa"
Output: 6
Explanation: Six palindromic strings: "a", "a", "a", "aa", "aa", "aaa".
```

**Constraints:**
- `1 <= s.length <= 1000`
- `s` consists of lowercase English letters.

## Concept Overview

This problem asks us to count the number of palindromic substrings in a given string. A palindrome is a string that reads the same backward as forward. There are several approaches to solve this problem, including dynamic programming and expanding around centers.

## Solutions

### 1. Best Optimized Solution - Expand Around Centers

Use the expand around centers approach to count the number of palindromic substrings.

```python
def countSubstrings(s):
    if not s:
        return 0
    
    n = len(s)
    count = 0
    
    # Helper function to expand around center
    def expand_around_center(left, right):
        local_count = 0
        while left >= 0 and right < n and s[left] == s[right]:
            local_count += 1
            left -= 1
            right += 1
        return local_count
    
    # Check each position as a potential center
    for i in range(n):
        # Odd length palindrome with center at i
        count += expand_around_center(i, i)
        
        # Even length palindrome with center at i and i+1
        count += expand_around_center(i, i + 1)
    
    return count
```

**Time Complexity:** O(n^2) - We check each position as a potential center and expand around it, which takes O(n) time for each position.
**Space Complexity:** O(1) - We only use a constant amount of extra space.

### 2. Alternative Solution - Dynamic Programming

Use dynamic programming to count the number of palindromic substrings.

```python
def countSubstrings(s):
    if not s:
        return 0
    
    n = len(s)
    # dp[i][j] will be True if the substring s[i:j+1] is a palindrome
    dp = [[False] * n for _ in range(n)]
    count = 0
    
    # All substrings of length 1 are palindromes
    for i in range(n):
        dp[i][i] = True
        count += 1
    
    # Check for substrings of length 2
    for i in range(n - 1):
        if s[i] == s[i + 1]:
            dp[i][i + 1] = True
            count += 1
    
    # Check for substrings of length 3 or more
    for length in range(3, n + 1):
        for i in range(n - length + 1):
            j = i + length - 1
            if s[i] == s[j] and dp[i + 1][j - 1]:
                dp[i][j] = True
                count += 1
    
    return count
```

**Time Complexity:** O(n^2) - We fill in the dp table, which has n^2 entries.
**Space Complexity:** O(n^2) - We use the dp table to store the results of all subproblems.

### 3. Alternative Solution - Manacher's Algorithm

Use Manacher's Algorithm to count the number of palindromic substrings.

```python
def countSubstrings(s):
    if not s:
        return 0
    
    # Preprocess the string to handle even-length palindromes
    t = '#' + '#'.join(s) + '#'
    n = len(t)
    
    # p[i] is the radius of the palindrome centered at i
    p = [0] * n
    
    # Variables to track the center and right boundary of the rightmost palindrome
    center = right = 0
    
    for i in range(n):
        # If i is within the right boundary, we can use the symmetry property
        if i < right:
            p[i] = min(right - i, p[2 * center - i])
        
        # Expand around center i
        while i + p[i] + 1 < n and i - p[i] - 1 >= 0 and t[i + p[i] + 1] == t[i - p[i] - 1]:
            p[i] += 1
        
        # Update the center and right boundary if needed
        if i + p[i] > right:
            center = i
            right = i + p[i]
    
    # Count the number of palindromic substrings
    count = 0
    for radius in p:
        count += (radius + 1) // 2
    
    return count
```

**Time Complexity:** O(n) - Manacher's Algorithm processes each character exactly once.
**Space Complexity:** O(n) - We use the p array to store the radius of each palindrome.

## Solution Choice and Explanation

The Expand Around Centers solution (Solution 1) is the best approach for this problem because:

1. **Efficiency**: It achieves O(n^2) time complexity, which is good for this problem, and the space complexity is O(1), which is better than the O(n^2) space complexity of the dynamic programming solution.

2. **Simplicity**: It's the most straightforward and elegant solution, requiring only a few lines of code.

3. **Intuitiveness**: It naturally maps to the concept of expanding around the center of a palindrome.

The key insight of this approach is to recognize that a palindrome can be expanded from its center. We consider each position in the string as a potential center and expand around it to count the number of palindromic substrings. We need to handle both odd-length palindromes (with a single character at the center) and even-length palindromes (with two characters at the center).

For example, let's trace through the algorithm for s = "abc":

1. Initialize:
   - count = 0

2. Check each position as a potential center:
   - Position 0 ('a'):
     - Odd length: expand_around_center(0, 0) = 1
     - Even length: expand_around_center(0, 1) = 0
     - count += 1 + 0 = 1
   - Position 1 ('b'):
     - Odd length: expand_around_center(1, 1) = 1
     - Even length: expand_around_center(1, 2) = 0
     - count += 1 + 0 = 2
   - Position 2 ('c'):
     - Odd length: expand_around_center(2, 2) = 1
     - Even length: expand_around_center(2, 3) = 0
     - count += 1 + 0 = 3

3. Return count = 3

For s = "aaa":

1. Initialize:
   - count = 0

2. Check each position as a potential center:
   - Position 0 ('a'):
     - Odd length: expand_around_center(0, 0) = 1
     - Even length: expand_around_center(0, 1) = 1
     - count += 1 + 1 = 2
   - Position 1 ('a'):
     - Odd length: expand_around_center(1, 1) = 1
     - Even length: expand_around_center(1, 2) = 1
     - count += 1 + 1 = 4
   - Position 2 ('a'):
     - Odd length: expand_around_center(2, 2) = 1
     - Even length: expand_around_center(2, 3) = 0
     - count += 1 + 0 = 5

3. Wait, the count should be 6. Let's double-check:
   - Single characters: "a", "a", "a" (3)
   - Two-character palindromes: "aa", "aa" (2)
   - Three-character palindrome: "aaa" (1)
   - Total: 3 + 2 + 1 = 6

Let's trace through the algorithm again for s = "aaa":

1. Initialize:
   - count = 0

2. Check each position as a potential center:
   - Position 0 ('a'):
     - Odd length: expand_around_center(0, 0) = 1
       - Palindrome: "a"
     - Even length: expand_around_center(0, 1) = 1
       - Palindrome: "aa"
     - count += 1 + 1 = 2
   - Position 1 ('a'):
     - Odd length: expand_around_center(1, 1) = 1
       - Palindrome: "a"
     - Even length: expand_around_center(1, 2) = 1
       - Palindrome: "aa"
     - count += 1 + 1 = 4
   - Position 2 ('a'):
     - Odd length: expand_around_center(2, 2) = 1
       - Palindrome: "a"
     - Even length: expand_around_center(2, 3) = 0
       - No palindrome
     - count += 1 + 0 = 5

3. But we're still missing the three-character palindrome "aaa".

Let's fix the algorithm:

```python
def countSubstrings(s):
    if not s:
        return 0
    
    n = len(s)
    count = 0
    
    # Helper function to expand around center
    def expand_around_center(left, right):
        local_count = 0
        while left >= 0 and right < n and s[left] == s[right]:
            local_count += 1
            left -= 1
            right += 1
        return local_count
    
    # Check each position as a potential center
    for i in range(n):
        # Odd length palindrome with center at i
        count += expand_around_center(i, i)
        
        # Even length palindrome with center at i and i+1
        count += expand_around_center(i, i + 1)
    
    return count
```

Now let's trace through the corrected algorithm for s = "aaa":

1. Initialize:
   - count = 0

2. Check each position as a potential center:
   - Position 0 ('a'):
     - Odd length: expand_around_center(0, 0) = 1
       - Palindrome: "a"
     - Even length: expand_around_center(0, 1) = 1
       - Palindrome: "aa"
     - count += 1 + 1 = 2
   - Position 1 ('a'):
     - Odd length: expand_around_center(1, 1) = 1
       - Palindrome: "a"
     - Even length: expand_around_center(1, 2) = 1
       - Palindrome: "aa"
     - count += 1 + 1 = 4
   - Position 2 ('a'):
     - Odd length: expand_around_center(2, 2) = 1
       - Palindrome: "a"
     - Even length: expand_around_center(2, 3) = 0
       - No palindrome
     - count += 1 + 0 = 5

3. We're still missing the three-character palindrome "aaa".

Let's fix the algorithm one more time and trace through it carefully:

```python
def countSubstrings(s):
    if not s:
        return 0
    
    n = len(s)
    count = 0
    
    # Helper function to expand around center
    def expand_around_center(left, right):
        local_count = 0
        while left >= 0 and right < n and s[left] == s[right]:
            local_count += 1
            left -= 1
            right += 1
        return local_count
    
    # Check each position as a potential center
    for i in range(n):
        # Odd length palindrome with center at i
        count += expand_around_center(i, i)
        
        # Even length palindrome with center at i and i+1
        count += expand_around_center(i, i + 1)
    
    return count
```

For s = "aaa":

1. Initialize:
   - count = 0

2. Check each position as a potential center:
   - Position 0 ('a'):
     - Odd length: expand_around_center(0, 0)
       - left = 0, right = 0: s[0] = s[0], local_count = 1, left = -1, right = 1
       - left = -1 < 0, stop expanding
       - Return local_count = 1
     - Even length: expand_around_center(0, 1)
       - left = 0, right = 1: s[0] = s[1], local_count = 1, left = -1, right = 2
       - left = -1 < 0, stop expanding
       - Return local_count = 1
     - count += 1 + 1 = 2
   - Position 1 ('a'):
     - Odd length: expand_around_center(1, 1)
       - left = 1, right = 1: s[1] = s[1], local_count = 1, left = 0, right = 2
       - left = 0, right = 2: s[0] = s[2], local_count = 2, left = -1, right = 3
       - left = -1 < 0, stop expanding
       - Return local_count = 2
     - Even length: expand_around_center(1, 2)
       - left = 1, right = 2: s[1] = s[2], local_count = 1, left = 0, right = 3
       - left = 0, right = 3: s[0] is out of bounds, stop expanding
       - Return local_count = 1
     - count += 2 + 1 = 5
   - Position 2 ('a'):
     - Odd length: expand_around_center(2, 2)
       - left = 2, right = 2: s[2] = s[2], local_count = 1, left = 1, right = 3
       - right = 3 >= n, stop expanding
       - Return local_count = 1
     - Even length: expand_around_center(2, 3)
       - right = 3 >= n, stop expanding
       - Return local_count = 0
     - count += 1 + 0 = 6

3. Return count = 6

Now we get the correct answer of 6. The issue was in the tracing, not in the algorithm.

The Dynamic Programming solution (Solution 2) is also efficient but uses more space. It's useful for understanding the dynamic programming approach to this problem. The Manacher's Algorithm solution (Solution 3) is the most efficient with O(n) time complexity, but it's more complex and harder to understand.

In an interview, I would first mention the Expand Around Centers solution as the most intuitive approach for this problem, and then discuss the Dynamic Programming and Manacher's Algorithm solutions as alternatives if asked for different approaches.
