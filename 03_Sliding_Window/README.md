# 03. Sliding Window

## Concept Overview

The Sliding Window technique is a computational pattern that aims to reduce the use of nested loops in algorithms. It's particularly useful for problems that involve arrays or strings where we need to find a subarray or substring that satisfies certain conditions.

### Key Concepts
- **Fixed-Size Window**: The window size remains constant throughout the algorithm
- **Variable-Size Window**: The window size can grow or shrink based on certain conditions
- **Window Boundaries**: Defined by two pointers (start and end)
- **Window State**: Information about the current window (e.g., sum, frequency of elements)

### Common Applications
- Finding subarrays/substrings of a specific length that satisfy certain conditions
- Finding the longest/shortest subarray/substring that satisfies certain conditions
- Calculating maximum/minimum sum of a subarray of a specific length
- Finding anagrams or permutations in a string

### Advantages
- Reduces time complexity from O(nÂ²) to O(n) for many problems
- Avoids redundant calculations by reusing the result from the previous window
- Efficiently processes large datasets with minimal space overhead
